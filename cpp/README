This TicTacToe was tested on both Linux and Windows.  You will need to install gnuwin32 make and tdm-gcc on windows to be able to use the makefile.

To compile:
$ make

To run:
$ ./Main.exe [host] [port]

Once the program is running on client and server, it should prompt for anything that must be entered.
