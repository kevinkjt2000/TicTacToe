My program can be compiled by typing make at the command prompt.

C:> make

After make runs succesfully there should be a Main.exe in the directory.

C:> Main.exe [host] [port]

Host and port are both required or Main.exe will do nothing but print command usage.

Once the program is running it should prompt for anything that must be entered.
